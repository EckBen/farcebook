# Farcebook

This is a Facebook-like social media page. It was modeled after Facebook both in design and function. I used Ruby on Rails and CSS with a few minor Javascript elemtents to create this application.

### Future Directions

In time, I plan to add some more Javascript elements to the page to make it function more smoothly. I also plan to add functionality to upload pictures instead of links for both profile pictures and picture posts.
